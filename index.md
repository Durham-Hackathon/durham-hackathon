# Numerical Simulation

Numerical simulation helps us to explore and understand complex phenomenons in nature, psychology, science and engineering.
A numerical simulation is a program that computes the evolution of a physical system in space and time, for example:
- the movement of stars and galaxies in the universe since the big bang,
- the propagation of a wood fire over time,
- the chemical reaction between molecules,
- the dragging progress of cars in a traffic jam.

During this hackathon you will learn how to program your first numerical simulation - your very own bouncy ball pit!

### Let's code a bouncy ball pit!

2. [How to drop a ball *for real*](/durham-hackathon/newton.html)
3. [How to bounce a ball](/durham-hackathon/bounce.html)
4. [How to bounce a whole lot of balls](/durham-hackathon/many-balls.html)
5. [Getting on](/durham-hackathon/getting-on.html)

### Let's get real with some more advanced physics:

6. [How to derive the equations of motion?](/durham-hackathon/motion-equations.html)
<!--7. [What about friction?](/durham-hackathon/friction.html)-->
<!--8. [How to "lose" energy?](/durham-hackathon/energy.html)-->
<!--9. [How about different masses?](/durham-hackathon/mass.html)-->
