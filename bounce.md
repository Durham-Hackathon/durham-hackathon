## Improving the simulation: What happens when we reach the floor?

Next let's simulate what happens when we hit the floor. What we expect is that the ball (if it is perfectly elastic) will bounce back up. In a perfectly elastic collision no energy is lost, that's not entirely realistic but it where we will start.

So the ball needs to change direction, or in other words, the velocity of the ball will change signs:

$$v \rightarrow -v$$

<h3>Add bounce:</h3> 
<form> 
<textarea id="bounce-code" cols="40" rows="15">import turtle

width = 300
height = 400
window = turtle.Screen()
window.setup(width, height)

gravity = -9.81
h = 0.08
vx = 0 # Starting velocity in x direction
vy = 0 # Starting velocity in y direction

ball = turtle.Turtle()
ball.penup()
ball.color("red")
ball.shape("circle")

while True:
    # Add your code here
    vy = vy + h*gravity
    y = ball.ycor() + h*vy
    ball.sety(y)
</textarea><br /> 
<button type="button" onclick="runit()">Run</button> 
</form> 
<pre id="bounce-output" ></pre> 
<!-- If you want turtle graphics include a canvas -->
<div id="bounce-canvas"></div> 

</body> 

</html>

After you've got it bouncing off the floor introduce a ceiling and walls. The ball should bounce of the ceiling and the walls in the same way as it does off the floor. What do you need to change? What remains the same?

You will need to introduce a second velocity component. So now you have $$v_x$$ and $$v_y$$ giving the x and y components of the velocity. To bounce off a ceiling or floor we modify the y component of the velocity, to bounce off of a wall we modify the x component.

Modify your while loop to include updates to the x-coordinate of the ball and the x velocity of the ball. Bear in mind that gravity does not act in the horizontal plane.

You will need to know the location of the floor as well. At the top you will see the size of the screen being set to `width` and `height`. Use these for your checks. The canvas is centered at 0. That means the floor will be at `-height/2` and the ceiling at `height/2`. The walls area analogously at `-width/2` and `width/2`.

To test these you need to modify the starting velocity which is currently set to 0 in x and y directions.
